- 👋 Hi, I’m @everettcole and am very new to coding!
- 👀 I’m interested in many different things anywhere from cars to psychology, math and problem solving!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning very intro level coding and my goal is to see if coding is something that interests me and see what sort of opportunities it can provide.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any project I am working on and I would love to work on other's projects as well if they are willing!
- 📫 How to reach me: I have my discord connected @yachtlcubeverett and am quite responsive on it!
